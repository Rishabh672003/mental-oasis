            <p class="title">National Suicide Hotline</p>
            <p><strong>Suicide is the act of intentionally ending one's own life</strong>. It is a complex and tragic
               phenomenon with multiple causes, including mental illness, emotional distress, trauma, substance abuse,
               and social isolation. Suicide can have devastating effects on the individual, their loved ones, and the
               community at large. It is a serious public health concern, and prevention efforts often involve
               increasing access to mental health resources, reducing stigma around seeking help, and promoting social
               support and connectedness..</p>
