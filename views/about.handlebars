      <span class="subtitle">Mental health is a critical component of overall
        health and wellbeing. According to the World Health Organization, mental
        health is defined as a state of well-being in which an individual can
        realize their own potential, cope with the normal stresses of life, work
        productively, and contribute to their community. Unfortunately, mental
        health problems are all too common, with an estimated 1 in 4 people
        worldwide experiencing mental health issues at some point in their
        lives.
        <br /><br />
        The consequences of poor mental health can be devastating, affecting
        every aspect of a person's life from their relationships and work to
        their physical health and overall quality of life. However, the good
        news is that with the right support and tools, individuals can take
        steps to improve their mental health and wellbeing.
        <br /><br />
        Our mental health application aims to provide those tools and support,
        helping individuals to track their mental health, manage their
        medications, and stay on top of their wellbeing. By using our
        application, individuals can take proactive steps to promote better
        mental health and wellbeing, and work towards achieving their full
        potential in life.
        <br /><br />
        By prioritizing mental health and using tools like our mental health
        application, we can all work towards a healthier, happier future.</span>
