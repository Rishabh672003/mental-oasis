  ## Description
   This project helps the user track their mental health with medication intake tracker, inspirational quotes, a calendar to track good days and bad days, input journal entries, and links to several helpline websites and call information. Mental health tracker is a great way to help the user in many different ways and aims to decrease negative effects on oneself. So many people suffer from some sort of mental health problems and not many feel like they have the information needed to get the help they need, or have a way to try to control the problems they have. Hopefully this application will help users maintain a healthy mind.
